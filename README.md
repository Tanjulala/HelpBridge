### **Project Title : HelpBridge - Bridging Hope in Times of Crisis**

**HelpBridge** is a desktop-based donation management system developed to support communities during critical situations such as natural disasters, pandemics, and extreme poverty. In times of crisis, aid efforts often suffer from poor coordination, lack of transparency, and delays in reaching the affected individuals. HelpBridge aims to solve these issues by providing a centralized platform that efficiently connects donors with support seekers through structured processes and user roles.

The system includes four major roles: **Admin**, **Volunteer**, **Citizen**, and **Support Seeker**. Admins manage the platform by adding volunteers, manage users, and monitoring system activities. Volunteers are responsible for creating and managing crisis events, verifying aid requests and donations, and updating distribution status. Citizens can register, log in, and contribute items, funds, or services, while also tracking the progress of their donations. Support Seekers can register and request help based on their needs, and later track the status of their requests.

HelpBridge ensures secure login and role-based access, verified donation workflows, and transparent tracking of all activities. Its goal is to reduce delays, prevent mismanagement, and build a reliable channel for humanitarian aid, making crisis response faster, more effective, and trustworthy. By bringing structure to chaos, HelpBridge empowers communities to respond quickly and compassionately during times of urgent need.
